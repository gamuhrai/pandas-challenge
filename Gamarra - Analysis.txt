Summary:
High School math and reading scores are consistant across grades in each high school.
Meaning, there is little difference of scores in each school irrespective of grade level.
This could speak to the caliber of stduent and/or teaching staff. 
High 'per student budget' or money spent on each student did not necessarily translate
to a high "% Overall Passing" rate. ie: huang high school had the highest 'per student budget'
with 655$ with an '% overall passing' of 53.51%. In fact, the lowest performing schools are spending
the most per student.
Score by size data shows that a student body over 2000 seems to have low passing rates for both 
math and reading. 
Score by type data shows that charter schools have higher overall passing rates. charter schools
with 90% vs district school's 54%
